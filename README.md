# Identifying-Polygons
A web-app that helps with Identifying Polygons

This web app helps identify the differnet types of polygons. It was a part of a Codepen challenge where you have to use polygons as your main inspiration.
With this project I chose to position almost everthing using CSS Flexbox. This project is also my first attempt at using SVG's. All of the polygons will be made using basic SVG code.
