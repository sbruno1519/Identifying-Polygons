This web app helps identify the differnet types of polygons. It was a part of an old Codepen challenge where you have to use polygons as your main inspiration. My personal goals for this challenge were use SVG's, and CSS Flexbox positioning for the first time. As well as use more advanced Javascript DOM methods.
